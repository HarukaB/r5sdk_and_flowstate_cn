0x2553C0: "mov qword ptr ss:[rsp+0x10], rsi" --> "xor rax, rax; ret"; // Unnecessary loop called from 'CModelLoader::UnloadModel'. This calls a 'nullsub' CMaterialGlue vtable method.

//---- PATCH1
0x6DA10: "sub     rsp, 28h" --> "xor rax, rax; ret"; // CClientState constructor; Removed due to high mem allocation during init (100MiB+). 'CClientState' is useless on dedicated, and all its feature are thereof disabled.

0x236354: "mov    edi, 0x2" --> "mov edi, 0x1"; // RPak array contains 2 elements: 1='common_early', 2='ui'. Changing size to 1 only loads 'common_early'. 'ui' is not needed for dedi.

//---- PATCH3
0x340D07: "mov     cs:g_pszMultiplayerUiPakName, rcx" --> "nop" // Prevent 'g_pszMultiplayerUiPakName' from being assigned to string "ui_mp.rpak" (prevents it from loading this pak file).

//---- PATCH4
0x296587: "jnz     short loc_1402971B7" --> "jmp     short loc_1402971B7" // Prevent 'fps_max' from being reset in 'CEngine::Frame' if 'sv_cheats' isn't set; this is bound to the server's tickrate in sdk code to save CPU time.
